# Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
# The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# 8
# Then, the output should be:
# 40320

# Hints:
# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be
# assumed to be a console input.


# all logic should be in side main method only
